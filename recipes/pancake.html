    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Pancakes</strong> are a classic breakfast dish made from a batter of flour, eggs, milk, and a leavening agent like baking powder, cooked on a griddle or skillet. They are soft, fluffy, and golden-brown, often served stacked and topped with butter, syrup, fruit, or whipped cream.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>Butter or oil (for cooking)</li>
    <li>Maple syrup or toppings of choice</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, mix the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until combined.</li>
    <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently stir until just combined. Do not overmix; the batter should be slightly lumpy.</li>
    <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil.</li>
    <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake.</li>
    <li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Flip the pancake and cook the other side until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
    <li>Serve warm with maple syrup, fresh fruits, or toppings of your choice.</li>
  </ol>
